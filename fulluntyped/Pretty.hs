{-

Pretty printer which omits all redundant brackets. It takes into
account three facts:

1. Application is left-associative, that is (x y) z = x y z

2. Lambda abstraction body stretches to the right as far as
possible: \x.y z k = \x.(y z k)

3. Application binds tighter than abstraction. I.e. we need parens
in the second expression here: (\x.x x) (\x.x x)
